Several solutions exist to address this specificity issue. 

**Solution 1 (Preferred): Increase Specificity**

If you intend for the paragraph within the div to be blue, make the selector more specific, overriding the `p` selector:

```css
div > p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The `>` ensures that only direct children of `div` are affected.

**Solution 2 (Less Preferred): Using `!important`**

Using `!important` is generally discouraged because it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug.  Use this solution cautiously and only as a last resort:

```css
div p {
  color: blue !important;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

This forces the `color: blue;` rule to take precedence.
