The following CSS rule is causing unexpected behavior because of the specificity conflict:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```

The second rule (`p { color: red; }`) is more specific than the first rule (`div p { color: blue; }`) and will override the first rule. The resulting text color will be red, even if the `p` tag is inside a `div` tag.
